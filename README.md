ghost2 is a modular, multi-feature Discord bot, and the spiritual successor to the original [ghost](https://github.com/ghost2-discord/ghost).
Among its features are a Spring-powered persistence layer, an embedded H2 database, simpler command modules,
Discord4J 3, and approximately 99.8% less spaghetti.
