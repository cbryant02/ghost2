# Contributing
We're always looking for more contributors! ghost2 welcomes Java developers of all types and all experience levels. To start programming with us, read the [contributor's guide](https://github.com/cbryant02/ghost2/wiki/Contributor's-guide) on the wiki for an extensive guide on cloning ghost2 and working with the command classes. If you have a decent amount of experience with Java, feel free to submit pull requests for general code improvements in other parts of the project as well; be aware that full documentation is currently a work-in-progress, though.

ghost2 is licensed under [GPL-3](https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3)), so you are entirely permitted to redistribute your own version or reuse part of the code as long as you follow the license terms.

As a final note: whether you're a developer or not, if you find any issues that haven't been documented yet, please by all means submit them to our [issue list](https://github.com/cbryant02/ghost2/issues).
